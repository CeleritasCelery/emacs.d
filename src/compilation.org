compilation mode will throw warnings about clearing large buffers, but
we don't need undo in compilation buffers anyways so we can just turn
that off

** windows

#+END_SRC
** keybindings
compillation can either be run in =compilation-mode= or in
=comint-mode= with =compilation-shell-minor-mode= enabled. The later
is needed when we want to interact with the running process. This has
a few issues that we are going to resolve now:

1. There is a weird issue where the recompile buffer is not the same
   as the original buffer. Therefore we force the buffer name to
   remain the same by overriding the =compilation-arguments=.

2. It is really convient to dismiss the compilation window with =q= so
   we are going to bind that. regular compilation-mode supports this
   binding by default.

3. We want to start in normal state, so we easily dismiss the
   window with =q= right when it first pops up if we want.

** ansi-color
Emacs can interpret ansi escape codes as font lock

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    "apply ANSI color codes in this buffer"

#+END_SRC

** errors
Define some custom rx forms that are common to all error messages
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-arx err-rx
    (append $rx-defaults
            '((fill (1+ (not (any space))))
              (filename (group-n 1 file))
              (line (group-n 2 nums))
              (col (group-n 3 nums))
              (info (opt "-I-:")))))
#+END_SRC

we need to define what errors look like in compilation and log
files. compilation mode has some defaults but they are not really
applicable to us. Also the built-in verilog mode tries to add all of
its error regexp's to the alist everytime it is loaded. This results
in a lot of extra processing that we don't want. Therefore we remove
that hook and set the alist back to our canonical version.

*** font lock fix
There is any issue where an error message spans multiple lines, the
font lock engine will sometimes stop parsing in the middle of it and
therefore it will never get highlighted. We fix this by creating our
own =font-lock-extend-region= function that makes sure we do not stop
on error messages.

ipgen will some times pull up a coreassembler prompt when it fails.
this can lead to a test being suck for a long time without alerting
the user. So we check for the CoreAssembler prompt and alert the user
if that is the case. We also add the buffer to a list of stalled runs
so that status is acurate when we list all compilations.

** utility

*** enviroment
we are doing two things here to make compliation more convient

1. we want to compile with tcsh because that is the standard login shell
for EC machines and some of the compilation setup scripts require it,
we could make it work with bash, but this is easier.

2. by setting the compliation root, we can ensure that we are only
prompted to save buffers that actaully exist in the project instead of
it trying prompt us to save all buffers.
